                Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove, and in
                it a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement. But the scroll and
                the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to
                the shadows. We value a scroll above all for the way it blends
                with the walls of the alcove, and thus we consider the mounting
                quite as important as the calligraphy or painting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if
                it fails to blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular
                distinction may blend beautifully with the room and set off to
                unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings. Wherein
                lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work to produce such an
                effect?
            </p>
            <p>
                Most often the paper, the ink, the fabric of the mounting will
                possess a certain look of antiquity, and this look of antiquity
                will strike just the right balance with the darkness of the
                alcove and room. We have all had the experience, on a visit to
                one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a
                scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large,
                deeply recessed alcove.
            </p>
            <p>
                So dark are these alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can
                hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is listen
                to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the
                all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how
                magnificent a painting it must be. Yet the combination of that
                blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute
                harmony. The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems
                rather to suit the painting perfectly.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate
                surface upon which the faint, frail light can play; it performs
                precisely the same function as the sand-textured wall. This is
                why we attach such importance to age and patina. A new painting,
                even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite
                destroy the shadows of an alcove, unless it is selected with the
                greatest care.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting, the
                paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest,
                and the alcove where it is darkest. Whenever I see the alcove of
                a tastefully built Japanese room, I marvel at our comprehension
                of the secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of shadow and
                light. For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some
                clever device.
            </p>

                An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so
                that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness.
                There is nothing more. And yet, when we gaze into the darkness
                that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase,
                beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere
                shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this small
                corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter
                silence; that here in the darkness immutable tranquility holds
                sway.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak probably
                refers to the uncanny silence of these dark places. And even we
                as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into
                the depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never
                penetrated. Where lies the key to this mystery? illtimately it
                is the magic of shadows. Were the shadows to be banished from
                its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert to mere
                void.
