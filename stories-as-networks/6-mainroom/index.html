                In temple architecture the main room stands at a considerable
                distance from the garden;
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-2">
                so dilute is the light there that no matter what the season,
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-3">
                on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening,
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-4">the pale, white glow scarcely varies.</p>
            <p class="scroll-5">
                And the shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely
                immobile,
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-6">
                as if dust collected in the corners had become a part of the
                paper itself.
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-7">
                I blink in uncertainty at this dreamlike luminescence,
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-8">
                feeling as though some misty film were blunting my vision.
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-9">The light from the pale white paper,</p>
            <p class="scroll-10">
                powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove,
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-11">is instead repelled by the darkness,</p>
            <p class="scroll-12">
                creating a world of confusion where dark and light are
                indistinguishable.
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-13">
                Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the light that
                suffuses such a room,
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-14">
                a rare tranquility not found in ordinary light?
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-15">
                Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the ageless,
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-16">
                a fear that in that room you might lose all consciousness of the
                passage of time,
            </p>
            <p class="scroll-17">
                that untold years might pass and upon emerging you should find
                you had grown old and gray?
