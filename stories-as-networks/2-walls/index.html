                And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room
                depends on a variation of shadows, heavy shadows against light
                shadows-it has nothing else.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight"
                >Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese rooms,
                perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight">
                Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to
                comprehend the mystery of shadows.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight">
                Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at
                best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on a
                veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight">
                The light from the garden steals in but dimly through
                paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light
                that makes for us the charm of a room.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight">
                We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile,
                dying rays can sink into absolute repose.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight">
                The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy
                finish, but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be
                of day textured with fine sand.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight">
                A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty of the
                feeble light.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight">
                We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays
                clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what
                little life remains to them.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight">
                We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these
                dim shadows far surpass any ornament.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight">
                And so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish
                the walls with sand in a single neutral color.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight">
                The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of
                difference will be ever so slight; not so much a difference in
                color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in
                the mood of the viewer.
            </span>

            <span class="highlight">
                And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the
                shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own.
