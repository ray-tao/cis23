            And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of
            these huge buildings, to which sunlight never penetrates, how the
            gold leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant glimmer
            from the garden, then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow, a faint
            golden light cast into the enveloping darkness, like the glow upon
            the horizon at sunset. In no other setting is gold quite so
            exquisitely beautiful. You walk past, turning to look again, and yet
            again; and as you move away the golden surface of the paper glows
            ever more deeply, changing not in a flash, but growing slowly,
            steadily brighter, like color rising in the face of a giant. Or
            again you may find that the gold dust of the background, which until
            that moment had only a dull, sleepy luster, will, as you move past,
            suddenly gleam forth as if it had burst into flame.

            How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a
            mystery to me. But I see why in ancient times statues of the Buddha
            were gilt with gold and why gold leaf covered the walls of the homes
            of the nobility. Modem man, in his well-lit house, knows nothing of
            the beauty of gold; but those who lived in the dark houses of the
            past were not merely captivated by its beauty, they also knew its
            practical value; for gold, in these dim rooms, must have served the
            function of a reflector. Their use of gold leaf and gold dust was
            not mere extravagance. Its reflective properties were put to use as
            a source of illumination. Silver and other metals quickly lose their
            gloss, but gold retains its brilliance indefinitely to light the
            darkness of the room. This is why gold was held in such incredibly
            high esteem.
