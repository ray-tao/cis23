        <h1 class="title">Study Bay (書院)</h1>
        <p>
            <span> The study bay, as the name suggests, </span>
            <span>
                was originally a projecting window built to provide a place for
                reading.
            </span>
            <span>
                Over the years it came to be regarded as no more than a source
                of light for the alcove;
            </span>
            <span>
                but most often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove as
                to soften the sidelong rays from without,
            </span>
            <span> to filter them through paper panels. </span>
            <span>
                There is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time it
                reaches these panels.
            </span>
            <span>
                The little sunlight from the garden that manages to make its way
                beneath the eaves and through the corridors
            </span>
            <span> has by then lost its power to illuminate, </span>
            <span> seems drained of the complexion of life. </span>
            <span>
                It can do no more than accentuate the whiteness of the paper.
            </span>
            <span>
                I sometimes linger before these panels and study the surface of
                the paper,
            </span>
            <span class="bright"> bright, </span>
            <span> but giving no impression of brilliance. </span>
